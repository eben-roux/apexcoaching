It's not often that at the age of 40 one gets to pursue their passion for people through coaching. At the beginning of 2020 I embarked on a journey to start my own coaching practice and 8 months into it, I find myself closer than I have ever been to living out my purpose.

The material that accompanies this message outlines my coaching focus and how I could potentially help you or someone you know gain a greater understanding of themselves and their leadership journey. Many of you have played a pivotal roles in my story and some of you I already have the privilege of coaching.

If there is something that piques your interest, please reach out and DM me and we can discuss this in more detail. Feel free to also forward this on to people you would believe would benefit from coaching.
