## Life Purpose
As a driven, authentic, and intentional person, I place a great importance on relationships
and connection. I am skilled at using encouragement and motivation to help people
to better understand both themselves and those around them. By connecting individuals
and teams with the best versions of themselves to increase self-awareness, theyʼre
able to access improved thinking and self-talk, as well as heightened emotional intelligence.
Ultimately, my purpose is to help individuals, leaders and teams to enhance their
strengths while recognising and overcoming their weaknesses. 

## Experience and Focus
I am not only an experienced people development specialist, but also someone who
understands the balance between work and personal life. I am a committed family
man, dedicated husband, and proud father of a young son. I also have a deep love
of the ocean and youʼll often find me out at backline, surfing before the start of a
busy day coaching and facilitating. I am a fiercely patriotic South African and enjoy
the simple pleasures of time spent with my family, whether itʼs at a rugby game,
camping and braaiing, or just being together in the outdoors. 

As a coach, I draw on a deep understanding and experience in general business, as
well as specific knowledge of sales and marketing. Along with the relevant coaching
accreditations, I also have first-hand experience in leading complex business change
and the leadership demands of corporate leadership in this space. My skills have
been developed through years of experience in various roles, with partners including
notable South African brands such as SAB, Varsity College, Jonsson Workwear and
Private Property.

I absolutely thrive on unlocking relational complexity in the workplace, specifically
when it has been brought on by rapid change. My specific coaching experience
encompasses all levels of leadership, from those just starting out their journey to individuals
in middle and senior management. These engagements have taken the form of both
one-on-ones and facilitated team sessions. This role is further complemented by my
working knowledge and experience in the creation of internal learning academies,
employee and team engagement initiatives, onboarding and induction, talent development
and succession planning, as well as general training and facilitation.
