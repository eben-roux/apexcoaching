## The Challenge - What do most leaders want to overcome?

In my 10 years as a people development specialist, I have seen leaders battling with
two main challenges:
* Gaining a good sense of perspective when the work landscape around them
 constantly changes.
* Overcoming relational and team complexity because of that changing land
 scape, particularly when it comes to finding the balance between prioritising
 the important and the urgent.

Leading people can be a lonely road and leaders often try to find the perspective
they need without help. This is difficult to do alone and, along with poor personal
rhythms and routines and a ʻfire and forgetʼ leadership style, often leads to burnout
and fallout. People see stress and fatigue as leadership badges of honour, but I
believe we have a duty to self-care. Failing to do so isnʼt just neglectful – it actually
means we are squandering our full potential.

## The Solution – what can be done to shift the old normal?
There is an African proverb that proclaims, “If you want to go fast, go alone – if you
want to go far, go together.” Solving challenges in isolation can be daunting and
make them seem insurmountable. You also cannot create heightened self-awareness
without first working with others – we are wired for connection and community. It is
in collaborating with the right people, and listening to the right voices, that you can
not only go far but also do it in a way that sustains energy, maintains perspective and
enables clarity of thought. Ultimately it is this collaboration that enables self-leadership
and, as a result, healthier guidance of the people you lead yourself.

## The Journey – where do I come in?
I work with individuals and teams to create positive and lasting change. My coaching
is grounded in the understanding that we are what we repeatedly do, and my
approach involves helping people to overcome challenges through attention, repetition
and encouragement. This creates sound patterns of self-leadership through enhanced
self-awareness. Not only does this help individuals to be fully present in their work
and life, it also ultimately empowers them to take control of what guides and drives
them.
My key strength lies in navigating relational complexity in the workplace. I do this by
helping my clients gain perspective and a clear understanding of their environment,
themselves, and their role in those spaces. My coaching niche lies in my ability to
create healthy rhythms, routines, and habits for those already on their leadership
journey or those just starting out, with the core belief that “It is not the mountain we
conquer, but ourselves.”
The Benefit – how can I help you learn, reflect and grow?
The business world does not stop. The optimal way for us to focus on our own journey,
however, is to slow down and allow the voice of an experienced and professional
coach to speak into those areas that challenge us by holding up a mirror to our lives,
understanding that the hardest person we will ever have to lead is ourselves.
Sustainable growth requires us to both experience events and then reflect on them. If
you want to grow your leadership abilities, you need to create space for intentional
reflection with someone you trust, who has integrity, and who wants to see you journey
toward a better place.

Who benefits the most from my coaching

 their teams.
* Leaders engaging in relational complexity, usually arising from a rapidly
 changing business landscape.
* New leaders embarking on discovering their own leadership style.
• Individuals wanting to create intentional and practical rhythms, routines, and
 habits to their lives.
* Anyone stuck in a rut needing new to change the way they solve problems, by
 changing the way they think.
